# CodePeek ðŸ‘€

Welcome to CodePeek, the ultimate Visual Studio Code extension that changes the way you interact with your code. With CodePeek, effortlessly generate and view a comprehensive contextual overview of your workspace. This powerful tool creates a `context.txt` file that not only maps out the entire structure of your project but also optionally includes the contents of selected files. Designed to seamlessly integrate with your language model (LLM) of choice, CodePeek ensures you have all the context you need when seeking assistance with your code. Elevate your coding efficiency and streamline your development workflow with CodePeek!

## Features

- **Generate Contextual Overview**: Create a `context.txt` file that lists all directories and files in your workspace, excluding commonly ignored files and directories and adds it into your `.gitignore` automatically.
- **Select Specific Files**: Choose specific files to include their content in the `context.txt` file.
- **Integrated UI**: Utilize a simple and intuitive webview panel within VS Code to select the files and directories to be included.
- **Status Bar Integration**: Easily access the context generation command from the status bar.

- `.git`
- `dist`
- `build`
- `coverage`
- `.vscode`
- `.idea`
- `.cache`
- `out`
- `tmp`
- `temp`

### Ignored Files

- `.DS_Store`
- `Thumbs.db`
- `.env`
- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`
- `.eslintcache`
- `.gitignore`
- `context.txt`
