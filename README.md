# CodePeek <span style="color:#D9BF2A;">ðŸ‘€</span>

Welcome to **CodePeek**, the ultimate Visual Studio Code extension that revolutionizes the way you interact with your code. Not only does CodePeek effortlessly generate a comprehensive contextual overview of your workspace, but it also captures your terminal sessions! This powerful tool creates `context.txt` and `terminalcontext.txt` files that map out the entire structure of your project, include contents of selected files, and capture terminal outputsâ€”all designed to seamlessly integrate with your language model (LLM) of choice. Elevate your coding efficiency and streamline your development workflow with CodePeek!

---

## Features

- **Generate Contextual Overview**: Create a `context.txt` file that lists all directories and files in your workspace. The extension automatically adds the generated file to `.gitignore`.
- **Select Specific Files**: Choose specific files to include their content in the `context.txt` file.
- **Terminal Context Capture**: Automatically capture terminal output and relevant files with terminal context saved in `terminalcontext.txt`. Simply save any file (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`), and CodePeek will capture the latest terminal context. _(Note: You may need to press save twice to ensure the terminal output is fully captured.)_ CodePeek also pulls in all the relevant files and its contents including the entire structure of your project!
- **Customize Terminal Prompt Recognition**: Specify your terminal prompt text in settings to accurately capture only the last command output.
- **Integrated UI**: Utilize a simple and intuitive webview panel within VS Code to select the files and directories to be included.
- **Status Bar Integration**: Easily access context generation commands from the status bar.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Creating a Context File

1. **Open your project** in Visual Studio Code.
2. In the status bar, click on **Create Context âœ¨**, or open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and select **Create Context**.
3. A webview panel will appear, showing the file structure of your workspace. Here, you can **select specific files** whose content you want to include in the `context.txt` file.
4. If no files are selected, only the directory structure will be saved in `context.txt`.
5. Click the **Create Context âœ¨** button to generate the `context.txt` file in your workspace.

### 2. Capturing Terminal Context

1. **Set Up Terminal Prompt Text**:

   - To ensure CodePeek accurately captures only the last command output, you need to **set your terminal prompt text** in the extension settings.
   - Go to **Settings** (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`), search for **`Codepeek: Prompt Text`**, and enter your terminal prompt text.
   - **Examples of Terminal Prompt Text**:
     - `user@hostname:~$`
     - `(venv) C:\Users\user\project>`
     - `PS C:\Users\user\project>`
     - `âžœ  ~/project`
     - `user@machine ~/project %`
   - This helps the extension identify where the last command starts in your terminal output.

2. **Automatic Capture on Save**:

   - Every time you **save a file** (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`), CodePeek automatically captures the latest terminal output and saves it to `terminalcontext.txt`. _(Note: You may need to press save twice to ensure the terminal output is fully captured.)_

3. **Manual Capture**:

   - You can also manually capture the terminal context by clicking on **Terminal Context ðŸ“‹** in the status bar or using the command **Generate Terminal Context** from the Command Palette.

4. **Default Behavior Without Prompt Text**:

   - If you do not set the `Codepeek: Prompt Text`, CodePeek will capture **the entire terminal output** instead of just the last command.
   - Setting the prompt text ensures more precise and relevant terminal context.

---

## Extension Settings

CodePeek provides the following settings to customize its behavior:

- **Codepeek: Prompt Text**

  - **Description**: Your terminal prompt text. The extension uses this text to identify the last command in your terminal.
  - **Usage**: Enter the exact string that appears at your terminal prompt before you type a command. This allows CodePeek to accurately extract only the output from the last executed command.
  - **Examples**:
    - If your terminal prompt looks like `user@hostname:~$`, enter `user@hostname:~$`.
    - For PowerShell users, if your prompt is `PS C:\Users\user\project>`, enter `PS C:\Users\user\project>`.
    - On macOS, if your prompt is `user@MacBook-Pro ~ %`, enter `user@MacBook-Pro ~ %`.
  - **Importance**: Setting this ensures that CodePeek captures only the output from the last command, making your `terminalcontext.txt` more focused and relevant.

## Automatically Ignored Files and Directories

When generating the `context.txt` or `terminalcontext.txt` files, CodePeek automatically ignores certain files and directories to keep the context clean and relevant. Here is the list of files and directories ignored by default:

### Ignored Directories

- `node_modules`
- `.git`
- `dist`
- `build`
- `coverage`
- `.vscode`
- `.idea`
- `.cache`
- `out`
- `tmp`
- `temp`
- `__pycache__`
- `logs`
- `venv`
- `target`

### Ignored Files

- `.DS_Store`
- `Thumbs.db`
- `.env`
- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`
- `.eslintcache`
- `.gitignore`
- `context.txt`
- `.npmrc`
- `tsconfig.json`
- **Various media formats** (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.mp4`, etc.)
- **Compressed archives** (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`)
- **Binary/executable files** (`.exe`, `.bin`, `.dll`)

## Installation

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions** view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`.
3. **Search for** `CodePeek`.
4. Click **Install**.

---

## Detailed Usage Guide

1. **Create Context âœ¨ Button**: Access this from the status bar to quickly generate a context file for your workspace.
2. **File Selection**: In the webview panel, tick the checkboxes to select specific files to include their contents in the context.
3. **Setting Terminal Prompt Text**:

   - Go to **Settings** (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
   - Search for **`Codepeek: Prompt Text`**.
   - Enter your terminal prompt text **exactly as it appears** in your terminal.
   - **Examples**:
     - If your terminal prompt looks like `user@hostname:~$`, enter `user@hostname:~$`.
     - For PowerShell users, if your prompt is `PS C:\Users\user\project>`, enter `PS C:\Users\user\project>`.
     - On macOS, if your prompt is `user@MacBook-Pro ~ %`, enter `user@MacBook-Pro ~ %`.
   - This is crucial for accurately capturing the last command's output in the terminal context.

4. **Terminal Context ðŸ“‹ Button**: Generate a terminal context file containing the last command output and related files from the terminal sessions.
5. **Automatic Terminal Capture**: Simply **save any file** in your workspace to automatically update the terminal context. _(Note: You may need to press save twice to ensure the terminal output is fully captured.)_
6. **Default Behavior Without Prompt Text**: If the prompt text is not set, CodePeek will capture the **entire terminal output**. Setting the prompt text refines the captured context.
7. **Git Ignore Integration**: CodePeek automatically updates your `.gitignore` to prevent the `context.txt` and `terminalcontext.txt` from being tracked by Git.
